GOAL: Create a facemash-like (cf what later gave birth to Facebook) but with tints of purple. Users will be ask which tint is the darkest


STEP1: Create the templates
		- vote.html
		- rankings.html
		- details.html
		- new_tint.html

		... all these of course come after "base.html"

		VOTE.HTML

			- 2 random tints - users will have to click on one of them
			- This page will also feature a "rankings" button. It shall redirect users to  "rankings.html"

		RANKINGS.HTML

			- Will display the list - whether horizontally or vertically, of all tints, sorted from the darkest to the brightest
			- Underneath - or besides, each tint, the hex notation shall appear
			- Their rank will be based on users' choices - applied to Chess' ELO algorithm
			- Each tint (image) will be clickable, and redirect users to "details.html"

		DETAILS.HTML

			- One page per tint
			- Shall display the tint itself
			- Its hex + RGB notation
			- Its ELO (+ ELO of rank ± 1)
			- Its rank (+ rank and hex name of rank ± 1)

		NEW_TINT.HTML

			- This page shall force me to practice forms
			- It shall enable the admin to upload, change, and remove another tint, but NOT the other tints

STEP2: Create the only model
		tint :
			hex_name
			rgb_name
			rank
			elo
			image
			number_of_clicks

		At the beginning, ranks shall all be equal to "1" because all tints shall start with a ELO of 1400
		Ranks shall always be based on the ELO - which means draws are possible

		The ELO shall be (more or less) the one used in Chess
		!!!! For the 1st implementation, counting the number of clicks shall be enough - but a second app - dedicated to this ranking might be necessary

STEP3: Create the views
		- vote.py
		- rankings.py
		- details.py
		- new_tint.py

STEP4: Define my urls
		This means a second pass will be necesary onto the templates.
